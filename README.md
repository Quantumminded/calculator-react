# Calculator Project with React

This is a simple calculator application built with React. The purpose of this project is to showcase the use of React for building a small web application.

# Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations
- Decimal point input
- Clear button to reset the calculator
- Error message when dividing by zero

# How it works

The calculator uses React state to keep track of the current input and result. When a user inputs a number or operation, the state is updated and the result is calculated. The result is then displayed on the calculator screen.

The calculator logic is implemented in the Calculator component. The handleInput function is called when a user inputs a number or operation. This function updates the state of the calculator and calculates the result. The handleClear function resets the calculator state to its default values.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a simple calculator application with React. It shows how to use React state to keep track of user input and how to perform basic math operations using JavaScript. With this foundation, you can extend the application to include additional features or improve its performance.
